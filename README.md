# Fynq

This repository now hosts the `fynq` web experience. The merged project is a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind application that serves as the official frontend for Fynq Solutions.

## Getting started

```bash
# install node modules (npm ci for a clean install once lock files are trusted)
npm install

# run the dev server
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build
```

If you prefer `yarn` or `pnpm`, install the dependencies with the corresponding package manager before running the scripts.

## Project structure

- `src/` - React entry point, pages, shared components, and `shadcn-ui` primitives
- `public/` - Static assets served at the project root (favicon, robots, etc.)
- `styles/` - Global styles, variables, and animations
- Configuration files such as `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`

Use `npm run dev` for development and `npm run build` to produce optimized output for deployment.

## Contribution workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-idea`
2. Make changes, run the available local checks (lint/tests if configured), and verify in the browser
3. Commit with a descriptive message and push your branch
4. Open a pull request targeting `main` so we can review and merge

## Deployment guidance

Deploy the `dist/` directory generated by `npm run build` to your preferred static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.). Update any environment-specific configuration (custom domains, redirects, caching) according to the host’s requirements.
