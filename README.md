## 📧 Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses EmailJS. To configure:

1. Sign up at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a service and template
3. Add your credentials to Vercel environment variables:
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

The site will automatically deploy on every push to main branch.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` - React entry point, pages, shared components, and `shadcn-ui` primitives
- `public/` - Static assets served at the project root (favicon, robots, etc.)
- `styles/` - Global styles, variables, and animations
- Configuration files such as `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`

Use `npm run dev` for development and `npm run build` to produce optimized output for deployment.

## Contribution workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-idea`
2. Make changes, run the available local checks (lint/tests if configured), and verify in the browser
3. Commit with a descriptive message and push your branch
4. Open a pull request targeting `main` so we can review and merge

## Deployment guidance

Deploy the `dist/` directory generated by `npm run build` to your preferred static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.). Update any environment-specific configuration (custom domains, redirects, caching) according to the host’s requirements.
